# Dense neural network tester
GUI Neural network tester for classification MNIST dataset, with fully connected layers, based on Java, JavaFX and Nd4j

### Background

This project was created for educational purposes. It was intendent to create neural network in Java from scratch and present results in GUI app. The project uses Maven, [Nd4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/docs/latest/nd4j-overview) as math library and was developed in IntelliJ IDEA. As a dataset was used [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

### Features
- images preview,
- setting the number of layers and neurons in each layer,
- setting dataset size, mni batch size and number of epochs
- setting learnign factor *Eta*.
- visualisation of accuracy and loss function.
